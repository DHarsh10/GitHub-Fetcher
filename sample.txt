Packages we use: 

1) npm install react router dom(client side router)

2) npm install axios(data fetching library) 


data fetching from:

https://api.github.com/users -> Public API for getting public github users data.
                                Github is giving it for free

API - Application Programming interface -> JSON data from the browser


we are not searching for individual users

React app ---> https://api.github.com/users ---> 30 random github users data
use axios to do the above process


search API -https://api.github.com/search/users?q=harsh  ---> to get the specific user in the input field

https://api.github.com/search/users?q=text



in initial load -> clear button false ->true when get user -> click clear button -> users should be empty

More button -> 3000/users/username -> https://api.github.com/users/DHarsh10 -> we have to display


https://api.github.com/users/DHarsh10/repos?per_page=5&sort=asc  ->fetch 5 repos
